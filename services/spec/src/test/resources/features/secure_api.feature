Feature: Secure the backend REST API
As an application provider, that is responsible for the consumer's data
I need to make sure:
That the API keeps their data safe and secure
That only the right people can modify it
That the content can not be tampered with by unauthorized gansters

Scenario: Data are secured when in transport - between Meritocracy client and Postgrest

Scenario: Data are secured when in transport - between Postgrest and Postgres
